# Purpose of this project🧐

> This program provides a PyQt-based interface that uses YOLOv5 and DeepSort for object detection and tracking in videos.

> When the program is executed, the user can select a video file. The selected video is then processed using the YOLOv5 model to detect objects, and the detected objects are tracked using the DeepSort algorithm. Tracked objects are assigned unique identifiers (IDs), and their trajectories are visually displayed.

>The interface includes "Play," "Pause," and "Replay" buttons. Clicking the "Play" button starts the object detection and tracking. The "Pause" button allows pausing the detection and tracking process, and the "Replay" button restarts the detection and tracking from the beginning.

>A dropdown list is provided for selecting the model, allowing the user to choose from various pretrained YOLOv5 models. The selected model is used for real-time object detection and tracking.

>This program provides a user-friendly environment for visualizing object detection and tracking, making it useful for tasks in video processing and computer vision.
